=======================
Installation On MacOS X
=======================

Installation on macOS against the Apple supplied Apache httpd server is no
longer supported as Apple removed the Apache build tools and configuration
required to build third party Apache modules. If you want to use macOS you must
use Homebrew to install the Apache httpd server and use it instead.
